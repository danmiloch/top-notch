WORK

We do honest, quality work at fair prices. 

REMOVAL
We excel at removing dangerous trees in hard-to-reach locations. We remove all the debris and offer stump grinding services. 


PRUNING
We prune woody plants. We can remove the deadwood from 100'  oak trees or delicately shape your ornamental trees. 

PLANT HEALTH
Our plant healthcare technicians are on the cutting edge of plant injection technology. If your trees or shrubs are struggling with pathogens, insect or fungal in nature we can provide a solution. 

CLEAN-UP

We respect your trees and your property.

We won’t leave a mess in your yard. Every job, big or small, includes yard clean-up. We’ll leave it better than we found it.

TEAM

When you work with us, you’re working with certified arborists.

Each of our climbers is a certified arborist: tried and tested in the realm of abasdlfkjasdf

“The crew at Top Notch Tree Care were wonderful!” 

They were friendly, professional, and quick. The office staff communicate well and are so nice!! On top of that, they are priced fair! If we ever decide to have any other tree removed or trimmed, I will definitely be calling them!
