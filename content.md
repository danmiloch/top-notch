WORK

We do honest, quality work at fair prices. 

REMOVAL
At a certain point a tree may become a liability, threatening your home, your business and your safety. We remove it efficiently while respecting your property. It takes trust to hire a company to move 10,000 lbs of material over your home. We understand that and endeavor to earn your trust by communicating clearly, offering proof of our insurance and paying attention to your concerns. We offer you the highest level of expertise in the tree care business by requiring annual arbor care educational opportunities and updated certification for all of our crew members.

PRUNING
We prune woody plants. We can remove the deadwood from 100'  oak trees or delicately shape your ornamental trees. 

PLANT HEALTH
Many of the trees we care for are located in urban areas. This can be a harsh environment to grow in, which is why we offer services to fertilize and protect these trees from disease and poor soil conditions. 

We are constantly striving to improve as we meet the growing demand for our services. Please understand that hiring us is a process; weather and demand factor greatly into our schedule. In order to provide better service, we are a year-round company and aim to communicate effectively at each step of your project. 


CLEAN-UP

We respect your trees and your property.

We won’t leave a mess in your yard. Every job, big or small, includes yard clean-up. We’ll leave it better than we found it.

TEAM

When you work with us, you’re working with certified arborists.

Each of our climbers is a certified arborist: tried and tested in the realm of abasdlfkjasdf

“The crew at Top Notch Tree Care were wonderful!” 

They were friendly, professional, and quick. The office staff communicate well and are so nice!! On top of that, they are priced fair! If we ever decide to have any other tree removed or trimmed, I will definitely be calling them!
